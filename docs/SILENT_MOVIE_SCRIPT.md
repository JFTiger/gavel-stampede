# Silent-Movie Spoken Lines (Jan-30)

Use short punctuations, not narration. Action → intertitle → one-liner.

## Opening (before start)
- “Ladies and gentlemen… we appear to have a gavel situation.”
- “This is what happens when the gavel thinks it can run.”

## Attempt #1 miss (SO CLOSE!)
- “Ooooh… that was close.”

## Attempt #2 miss / near-hit (ALMOST! / THAT WAS CLOSE!)
- “You could hear the wind off that one.”
Optional if crowd reacts:
- “That gavel has experience.”

## Final escape (GAVEL ESCAPED! / Donations Required)
- “And just like that… the gavel escapes again.”
(Beat)
- “Which means… we’re going to need donations.”

## Glitch lines (pick ONE, then move on)
- Minor glitch: “Let’s see if the gavel gets lucky this time.”
- Won’t start: “The gavel escaped so fast the computer couldn’t keep up.”
- Total failure: “Just like last year… the gavel got away.”
